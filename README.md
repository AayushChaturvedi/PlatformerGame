# PlatformerGame

To play the game:

1. Download/Clone this repository and save the folder at recognised place in your system.
  let's suppose that folder is saved in as Documents/game directory

2. Launch a local Server
    If you have Node, simply type the following in the command line
        npm -g install http-server
        cd Documents/game
        http-server
    If you have Python, type the following in the command line
        cd Documents/game
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3. The above step will display a PORTNUMBER where the system has set up a local server.
   In the browser, go to the URL : localhost:PORTNUMBER.
   For example, if your port has been setup at port 8000, go to 
   localhost:8000
   in your browser.
